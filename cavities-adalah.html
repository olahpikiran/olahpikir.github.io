                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>1) Voice
</p><p>
</p><p>In English we have both voiced and voiceless sounds. A sound fits into one of these categories according to how the vocal folds behave when a speech sound is produced.
</p><p>
</p><p>Voiced: Voiced sounds are sounds that involve vocal fold vibrations when they are produced. Examples of voiced sounds are /b,d,v,m/.
</p><p>
</p><p>If you place two fingers on either side of the front of your neck, just below your jawbone, and produce a sound, you should be able to feel a vibrating sensation. This tells you that a sound is voiced.
</p><p>
</p><p>Voiceless: Voiceless sounds are sounds that are produced with no vocal fold vibration. Examples of voiceless sounds in English are /s,t,p,f/.
</p><p>2) Place
</p><p>
</p><p>The vocal tract is made up of different sections, which play a pivotal role in the production of speech. These sections are called articulators and are what make speech sounds possible. They can be divided into two types.
</p><p>
</p><p>The active articulator is the articulator that moves towards another articulator in the production of a speech sound. This articulator moves towards another articulator to form a closure of some type in the vocal tract (i.e open approximation, close, etc – define)
</p><p>
</p><p>The passive articulator is the articulator that remains stationary in the production of a speech sound. Often, this is the destination that the active articulator moves towards (i.e the hard palate).

                            29. SOAL UJIAN MASUK UM UGM 2013     Historian have traced the first toothbrushes to the 11th-century China. They were made of
bristles from Siberian hogs, (51)_ _ _ in cold climates to increase their bristles. The bristles were attached (52)_ _ _ handles made of bamboo or wood.
During the Dark Ages in Europe, dental hygiene consisted of using help of a knife as a toothpick. (53)_ _ _ hog-bristle toothbrushes came to Europe in the 15th century, many people found the bristles too stiff, and preferred toothpick. Other people used horsehair or badger hair brushes, which were too soft to do much good.
(54)_ _ _, in England by the late 19th century, mass production of hog- bristletoothbrushes was underway, (55)_ _ _ 1938, in the United State, that toothbrushes made of synthetic nylon were introduced. Again, people found them too stiff.
Finally in the 1950s, softer nylon brushes arrived. As for toothpaste, (56)_ _ _ in an Egyptian tomb dating back 4000 years. Since it contained strong vinegar along with powdered pumice stone, it actually wore down tooth enamel, (57)_ _ _ decay.
The Romans had similar recipes, with similar results, but one of their ingredients was urine. The ammonia found in urine may offer protection (58)_ _ _ decay, and ammonia compounds are still used in some tooth-pastes today.
