Virtually everyone pours chemicals of one sort oranother down their drains or toilets. Even detergents usedin washingmachines and dishwashers eventually end up in our rivers and oceans. So do thepesticides we use on our gardens. A lot of toxic pollution also enters waste waterfrom highway runoff. Highways are typically covered with a cocktail of toxicchemicals-everything from spilled fuel and brake fluids to bits of worn tires(themselves made from chemical additives) and exhaust emissions. When it rains,these chemicals wash into drains and rivers. It is not unusual for heavy summerrainstorms to wash toxic chemicals into rivers in such concentrations that they killlarge numbers of fish overnight. It has been estimated that, in one year, thehighway runoff froma single large city leaks as much oil into our waterenvironment as a typical tanker spill. Some highway runoff runs away into drains;others can pollute groundwater or accumulate in the land next to a road, making itincreasingly toxic as the years go by.​</a>

In my point of view, by lowering air-conditioning demand, green roofs can reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming especially in cities.b. That is a good choice. In my view, our local sanitation department can tell you how to safely dispose of pesticides and other chemical waste in your area.c. I don't agree with you on that. I think there are environmental consequences associated with any countertop choice, or any consumer choice for that matter. d. Well, that is a good point. I believe that Electric heaters are the safest kind, according to the Department of Energy, so you've made a good choice, especially since children are involved e. Absolutely yes. In my opinion, Bamboo has long been regarded as an eco-friendly material because of its amazing green attributes: It can grow with few pesticides and little water.f. Harvesting rainwater simply means finding a way to capture rainfall and runoff so that it can be recycled and used for landscaping, and in some cases water for toilets, depending on water quality regulations​</a>

                                            Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi; born 21 June 1961) is the seventh President of Indonesia, in office since 2014. Previously he was the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. He is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.          Jokowi was nominated by his party, the Indonesian PDI Perjuangan, to run in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Jokowi was elected as Governor of Jakarta on 20 September 2012 after a second round runoff election in which he defeated the incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Jokowi's win was widely seen as reflecting popular voter support for "new" or "clean" leaders rather than the "old" style of politics in Indonesia.          His nomination as PDI-P candidate for the 2014 presidential election was announced on 14 March 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014. After some controversy about the result of the election, Jokowi was named as president-elect on 22 July. He was formally declared as the winner of the election by the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum or KPU), winning more than 53% of the vote over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.          Joko Widodo, who was awarded third pace in the 2012 World Mayor Project, became the elected governor of Jakarta in October 2012 after serving as mayor of Surakarta (Solo) since 2005. During his time as Mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) turned the crime-ridden city into a regional centre for arts and culture, which has started to attract international tourism. His campaign against corruption earned him the description of being the most honest politician in Indonesia. Joko Widodo's victory over Jakarta's incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo was largely due to his track record as mayor of his home town and his reputation for honesty and humility.

Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers andgroundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.2 Water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a storm drain, wastewater treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Poliution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Aill plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individuai species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganicsubstances. Elevated termperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.45)375 Water poliution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriateinfrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. Sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Nature-based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution.Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality. (5)​</a>

                                            A few statistics illustrate the scale of the problem that waste water (chemicals washed down drains and discharged from factories) can cause.Around half of all ocean pollution is caused by sewage and waste water.Each year, the world generates perhaps 5-10 billion tons of industrial waste, much of which is pumped untreated into rivers, oceans, and other waterways.In the United States alone, around 400,000 factories take clean water from rivers, ard many pump polluted waters back in their place.However, there have been major improvements in waste water treatment recently.Since 1970, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has invested abou: $70 billion in improving water treatment plants that, as of 2015, serve around 88 percent of the US population (compared to just 69 percent in 1972).However, another $271 billion is still needed to update and upgrade the system.Factories are point sources of water pollution, but quite a lot of water is polluted by ordinary people from nonpoint sources;this is how ordinary water becomes waste water in the first place.Virtually everyone pours chemicals of one sort or another down their drains or toilets.Even detergents used in washing machines and dishwashers eventually end up in our rivers and oceans.So do the pesticides we use on our gardens.A lot of toxic pollution also enters waste water from highway runoff.Highways are typically covered with a cocktail of toxic chemicals-everything from spilled fuel and brake fluids to bits of worn tires (themselves made from chemical additives) and exhaust emissions.When it rains these chemicals wash into drains and rivers.It is not unusual for heavy summer rainstorms to wash toxic chemicals into rivers in such concentrations that they kill large numbers of fish overnight.It has been estimated that, in one year, the highway runoff from a single large city leaks as much oil into our water environment as a typical tanker spill.Some highway runoff runs away into drains;others can pollute groundwater or accumulate in the land next to a road, making it increasingly toxic as the years go by.1.

                                            tolong yaJoko Widodo       Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi; born 21 June 1961) is the seventh President of Indonesia, in office since 2014. Previously he was the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. He is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.          Jokowi was nominated by his party, the Indonesian PDI Perjuangan, to run in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Jokowi was elected as Governor of Jakarta on 20 September 2012 after a second round runoff election in which he defeated the incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Jokowi's win was widely seen as reflecting popular voter support for "new" or "clean" leaders rather than the "old" style of politics in Indonesia.          His nomination as PDI-P candidate for the 2014 presidential election was announced on 14 March 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014. After some controversy about the result of the election, Jokowi was named as president-elect on 22 July. He was formally declared as the winner of the election by the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum or KPU), winning more than 53% of the vote over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.          Joko Widodo, who was awarded third pace in the 2012 World Mayor Project, became the elected governor of Jakarta in October 2012 after serving as mayor of Surakarta (Solo) since 2005. During his time as Mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) turned the crime-ridden city into a regional centre for arts and culture, which has started to attract international tourism. His campaign against corruption earned him the description of being the most honest politician in Indonesia. Joko Widodo’s victory over Jakarta’s incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo was largely due to his track record as mayor of his home town and his reputation for honesty and humility.Soal Latihan Bahasa Inggris Descriptive TextThe text below is for question number 1 - 10Peter is the youngest in our family.

In past centuries, Native Americans living in the arid areas of what is now the southwestern United States relied on a variety of strategies to ensure the success of their agriculture. First and foremost, water was the critical factor. The soil was rich because there was little rain to leach out the minerals, but the low precipitation caused its own problems. Long periods of drought could have made agriculture impossible; on the other hand, a sudden flood could just as easily have destroyed a crop. 
Several techniques were developed to solve the water problem. The simplest was to plant crops in the floodplains and wait for the annual floods to water the young crops.
A less dangerous technique was to build dikes or dams to control the flooding. These
dikes both protected the plants against excessive flooding and prevented the water from
escaping too quickly once it had arrived. The Hopi people designed their fields in a
checkerboard pattern, with many small dikes, each enclosing only one or two stalks of
maize (corn), while other groups built a series of dams to control the floods. A third
technique was to dig irrigation ditches to bring water from the rivers. Water was
sometimes carried to the fields in jars, particularly if the season was dry. Some crops
were planted where they could be watered directly by the runoff from cliff walls.
Another strategy Native Americans used to ensure a continuous food supply was to
plant their crops in more than one place, hoping that if one crop failed, another would
survive. However, since the soil was rich and not easily exhausted, the same patch of
ground could be cultivated year after year, whereas in the woodlands of the eastern
United States it was necessary to abandon a plot of ground after a few years of farming.
In the Southwest, often two successive crops were planted each year.
It was a common southwestern practice to grow enough food so that some could be
dried and stored for emergencies. If emergency supplies ran low, the people turned to
the local wild plants. If these failed, they moved up into the mountains to gather the
wild plants that might have survived in the cooler atmosphere.

                                            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</a>

Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers andgroundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.2 Water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a storm drain, wastewater treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Poliution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Aill plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individuai species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganicsubstances. Elevated termperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.45)375 Water poliution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriateinfrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. Sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Nature-based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution.Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality. (5)​</a>

                                            Joko Widodo        Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi; born 21 June 1961) is the seventh President of Indonesia, in office since 2014. Previously he was the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. He is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.           Jokowi was nominated by his party, the Indonesian PDI Perjuangan, to run in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Jokowi was elected as Governor of Jakarta on 20 September 2012 after a second round runoff election in which he defeated the incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Jokowi's win was widely seen as reflecting popular voter support for "new" or "clean" leaders rather than the "old" style of politics in Indonesia.           His nomination as PDI-P candidate for the 2014 presidential election was announced on 14 March 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014. After some controversy about the result of the election, Jokowi was named as president-elect on 22 July. He was formally declared as the winner of the election by the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum or KPU), winning more than 53% of the vote over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.           Joko Widodo, who was awarded third pace in the 2012 World Mayor Project, became the elected governor of Jakarta in October 2012 after serving as mayor of Surakarta (Solo) since 2005. During his time as Mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) turned the crime-ridden city into a regional centre for arts and culture, which has started to attract international tourism. His campaign against corruption earned him the description of being the most honest politician in Indonesia.

Sebelumnya ia adalah Walikota Surakarta pada periode 2005-2012 dan Gubernur Jakarta dari 2012 sampai 2014. Dia adalah orang Indonesia pertama yang menjadi presiden tanpa latar belakang politik atau militer berpangkat tinggi.           Jokowi dicalonkan menjadi oleh partainya, PDI Perjuangan Indonesia, untuk menjalankan di pemilihan gubernur jakarta pada tahun 2012 dengan Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (sering dikenal sebagai Ahok) sebagai pasangannya. Jokowi terpilih sebagai Gubernur DKI Jakarta pada 20 September 2012 setelah pemilihan putaran kedua di mana ia mengalahkan gubernur petahana Fauzi Bowo. Kemenangan Jokowi ini secara luas dilihat sebagai mencerminkan dukungan pemilih populer untuk "baru" atau pemimpin "bersih" daripada "tua" gaya politik di Indonesia.           pencalonannya sebagai kandidat PDI-P untuk pemilihan presiden 2014 diumumkan pada tanggal 14 Maret 2014. Pemilihan presiden digelar pada 9 Juli 2014. Setelah beberapa kontroversi tentang hasil pemilu, Jokowi disebut sebagai presiden terpilih pada 22 Juli. Ia secara resmi dinyatakan sebagai pemenang pemilu oleh Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU), memenangkan lebih dari 53% suara atas lawannya, Prabowo Subianto, yang disengketakan hasilnya dan menarik diri dari lomba sebelum menghitung selesai.           Joko Widodo, yang dianugerahi posisi ketiga di Walikota Dunia Terbaik 2012, menjadi gubernur terpilih Jakarta pada Oktober 2012 setelah sebelumnya menjabat sebagai walikota Surakarta (Solo) sejak tahun 2005.

Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers andgroundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.2 Water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a storm drain, wastewater treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Poliution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Aill plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individuai species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganicsubstances. Elevated termperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.45)375 Water poliution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriateinfrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants.

                            11. A few statistics illustrate the scale of the problem that waste water (chemicals washed down drains and discharged from factories) can cause.Around half of all ocean pollution is caused by sewage and waste water.Each year, the world generates perhaps 5-10 billion tons of industrial waste, much of which is pumped untreated into rivers, oceans, and other waterways.In the United States alone, around 400,000 factories take clean water from rivers, ard many pump polluted waters back in their place.However, there have been major improvements in waste water treatment recently.Since 1970, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has invested abou: $70 billion in improving water treatment plants that, as of 2015, serve around 88 percent of the US population (compared to just 69 percent in 1972).However, another $271 billion is still needed to update and upgrade the system.Factories are point sources of water pollution, but quite a lot of water is polluted by ordinary people from nonpoint sources;this is how ordinary water becomes waste water in the first place.Virtually everyone pours chemicals of one sort or another down their drains or toilets.Even detergents used in washing machines and dishwashers eventually end up in our rivers and oceans.So do the pesticides we use on our gardens.A lot of toxic pollution also enters waste water from highway runoff.Highways are typically covered with a cocktail of toxic chemicals-everything from spilled fuel and brake fluids to bits of worn tires (themselves made from chemical additives) and exhaust emissions.When it rains these chemicals wash into drains and rivers.It is not unusual for heavy summer rainstorms to wash toxic chemicals into rivers in such concentrations that they kill large numbers of fish overnight.It has been estimated that, in one year, the highway runoff from a single large city leaks as much oil into our water environment as a typical tanker spill.Some highway runoff runs away into drains;others can pollute groundwater or accumulate in the land next to a road, making it increasingly toxic as the years go by.1.

                            17. tolong yaJoko Widodo       Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi; born 21 June 1961) is the seventh President of Indonesia, in office since 2014. Previously he was the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. He is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.          Jokowi was nominated by his party, the Indonesian PDI Perjuangan, to run in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Jokowi was elected as Governor of Jakarta on 20 September 2012 after a second round runoff election in which he defeated the incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Jokowi's win was widely seen as reflecting popular voter support for "new" or "clean" leaders rather than the "old" style of politics in Indonesia.          His nomination as PDI-P candidate for the 2014 presidential election was announced on 14 March 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014. After some controversy about the result of the election, Jokowi was named as president-elect on 22 July. He was formally declared as the winner of the election by the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum or KPU), winning more than 53% of the vote over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.          Joko Widodo, who was awarded third pace in the 2012 World Mayor Project, became the elected governor of Jakarta in October 2012 after serving as mayor of Surakarta (Solo) since 2005. During his time as Mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) turned the crime-ridden city into a regional centre for arts and culture, which has started to attract international tourism. His campaign against corruption earned him the description of being the most honest politician in Indonesia. Joko Widodo’s victory over Jakarta’s incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo was largely due to his track record as mayor of his home town and his reputation for honesty and humility.Soal Latihan Bahasa Inggris Descriptive TextThe text below is for question number 1 - 10Peter is the youngest in our family.

In past centuries, Native Americans living in the arid areas of what is now the southwestern United States relied on a variety of strategies to ensure the success of their agriculture. First and foremost, water was the critical factor. The soil was rich because there was little rain to leach out the minerals, but the low precipitation caused its own problems. Long periods of drought could have made agriculture impossible; on the other hand, a sudden flood could just as easily have destroyed a crop. 
Several techniques were developed to solve the water problem. The simplest was to plant crops in the floodplains and wait for the annual floods to water the young crops.
A less dangerous technique was to build dikes or dams to control the flooding. These
dikes both protected the plants against excessive flooding and prevented the water from
escaping too quickly once it had arrived. The Hopi people designed their fields in a
checkerboard pattern, with many small dikes, each enclosing only one or two stalks of
maize (corn), while other groups built a series of dams to control the floods. A third
technique was to dig irrigation ditches to bring water from the rivers. Water was
sometimes carried to the fields in jars, particularly if the season was dry. Some crops
were planted where they could be watered directly by the runoff from cliff walls.
Another strategy Native Americans used to ensure a continuous food supply was to
plant their crops in more than one place, hoping that if one crop failed, another would
survive. However, since the soil was rich and not easily exhausted, the same patch of
ground could be cultivated year after year, whereas in the woodlands of the eastern
United States it was necessary to abandon a plot of ground after a few years of farming.
In the Southwest, often two successive crops were planted each year.
It was a common southwestern practice to grow enough food so that some could be
dried and stored for emergencies. If emergency supplies ran low, the people turned to
the local wild plants. If these failed, they moved up into the mountains to gather the
wild plants that might have survived in the cooler atmosphere.

                            19. In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</h2><br />

Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers andgroundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.2 Water pollution can be grouped into surface water pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a storm drain, wastewater treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Poliution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Aill plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individuai species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganicsubstances. Elevated termperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.45)375 Water poliution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriateinfrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. Sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Nature-based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution.Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality. (5)​</h2><br />

                            21. Joko Widodo        Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi; born 21 June 1961) is the seventh President of Indonesia, in office since 2014. Previously he was the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. He is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background.           Jokowi was nominated by his party, the Indonesian PDI Perjuangan, to run in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok) as his running mate. Jokowi was elected as Governor of Jakarta on 20 September 2012 after a second round runoff election in which he defeated the incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Jokowi's win was widely seen as reflecting popular voter support for "new" or "clean" leaders rather than the "old" style of politics in Indonesia.           His nomination as PDI-P candidate for the 2014 presidential election was announced on 14 March 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014. After some controversy about the result of the election, Jokowi was named as president-elect on 22 July. He was formally declared as the winner of the election by the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum or KPU), winning more than 53% of the vote over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.           Joko Widodo, who was awarded third pace in the 2012 World Mayor Project, became the elected governor of Jakarta in October 2012 after serving as mayor of Surakarta (Solo) since 2005. During his time as Mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) turned the crime-ridden city into a regional centre for arts and culture, which has started to attract international tourism. His campaign against corruption earned him the description of being the most honest politician in Indonesia. Joko Widodo’s victory over Jakarta’s incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo was largely due to his track record as mayor of his home town and his reputation for honesty and humility. Artinya: Joko Widodo            Joko Widodo (dikenal sebagai Jokowi; lahir pada 21 Juni 1961) adalah Presiden ketujuh Indonesia sejak 2014. Sebelumnya ia adalah Walikota Surakarta pada periode 2005-2012 dan Gubernur Jakarta dari 2012 sampai 2014. Dia adalah orang Indonesia pertama yang menjadi presiden tanpa latar belakang politik atau militer berpangkat tinggi.           Jokowi dicalonkan menjadi oleh partainya, PDI Perjuangan Indonesia, untuk menjalankan di pemilihan gubernur jakarta pada tahun 2012 dengan Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (sering dikenal sebagai Ahok) sebagai pasangannya. Jokowi terpilih sebagai Gubernur DKI Jakarta pada 20 September 2012 setelah pemilihan putaran kedua di mana ia mengalahkan gubernur petahana Fauzi Bowo. Kemenangan Jokowi ini secara luas dilihat sebagai mencerminkan dukungan pemilih populer untuk "baru" atau pemimpin "bersih" daripada "tua" gaya politik di Indonesia.           pencalonannya sebagai kandidat PDI-P untuk pemilihan presiden 2014 diumumkan pada tanggal 14 Maret 2014. Pemilihan presiden digelar pada 9 Juli 2014. Setelah beberapa kontroversi tentang hasil pemilu, Jokowi disebut sebagai presiden terpilih pada 22 Juli. Ia secara resmi dinyatakan sebagai pemenang pemilu oleh Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU), memenangkan lebih dari 53% suara atas lawannya, Prabowo Subianto, yang disengketakan hasilnya dan menarik diri dari lomba sebelum menghitung selesai.           Joko Widodo, yang dianugerahi posisi ketiga di Walikota Dunia Terbaik 2012, menjadi gubernur terpilih Jakarta pada Oktober 2012 setelah sebelumnya menjabat sebagai walikota Surakarta (Solo) sejak tahun 2005. Selama dia menjadi Walikota Surakarta, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) mengubah  kota yang penuh kejahatan menjadi pusat regional untuk seni dan budaya, dan telah mulai menarik pariwisata internasional. kampanye melawan korupsi membuatnya mendapatkan deskripsi menjadi politisi paling jujur di Indonesia. Kemenangan Joko Widodo atas Gubernur petahana Jakarta Fauzi Bowo sebagian besar disebabkan track record-nya sebagai walikota kota sebelumnya dan reputasinya untuk kejujuran dan kerendahan hati​</h2><br />
