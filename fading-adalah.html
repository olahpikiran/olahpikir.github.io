Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me
And it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherf*ckin' audience
A feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music</a>

                                            Ellen didn't know whether she quite believed him or not, but she thought it a lovely story anyway. After breakfast, Ellen put on snowsuit and boots and mittens and hood and went out to play in the yard with Butch, her pet. They romped in the snowbanks and tumbled on the ice. The morning was half gone in a twinkling. Better come in and warm up a bit." Ellen's mother called. And then she laughed. "Goodness! Jack Frost has certainly painted your nose!" Ellen loved the pictures she found on the windows these winter mornings. "Look!" she'd beg Paul. "There's a big castle on a hill-" "And there's the old witch climbing up to it," Paul teased. Ellen tugged off her boots hurriedly. She ran to a mirror, but there were no castles and fairies on her nose-only a bright red color that was already fading! "But it's fading away, Paul!" "Well, I didn't have an icicle paintbrush," Paul explained. "That's the difference." "Well," Ellen decided. "I guess Jack didn't have his icicle paintbrush today. He just had to use his finger, like Paul." "Oh, no, Paul, a fairy, a beautiful fairy! What makes the pictures?" asked Ellen. "Jack Frost paints them," Paul told her. "Every night he comes, with an icicle for a paintbrush and snow pies for his paintbox. First, he breathes on the window like this-"Paul blew on the pane and it clouded a misty gray, "-then, fast as fast, he draws his pictures." With his finger, Paul drew a comical face. "See?"​</a>

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

The Dying Words of Goethe
“Light more light! The shadows deepen,
And my life is ebbing low,
Throw the windows widely open:
Light! More light before I go
“Softly let the balmy sunshine
Play around my dying bed,
E’er the dimly lighted valley
I with lonely feet must tread
“Light! More light! For Death is weaving
Shadowns ‘round my warning sight,
And I fain would gaze upon him
Through a stream of earthly light.”
Not for greater gifts of genius;
Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
All the dying poet whispers
Is a prayer for light, more light.
Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
Fading slowly from his sight;
All the poet’s aspirations
Centre in that prayer for light
Gracious Saviour, when life’s day-dreams
Melt and vanish from the sight,
May our dim and longing vision
Then be blessed with light, more light. </a>

                                            "Causes of the Fading of Indonesian Culture"•General Statement (Opening)Culture in Indonesia is increasingly fading due to a lack of public awareness, lack of cultural learning, and lack of cultural communication. This is considered to have dropped dramatically because most of us choose foreign cultures that are more practical and in accordance with the times. That we think that foreign culture is more practical and cool. Even though this is not always true. Even though there are many foreign cultures that are considered cool but are not in accordance with the identity and culture of our nation, Indonesia.• A sequence of  explanationThe result is that our culture is not taken care of and slowly eliminated or claimed by other countries. For this reason, the ability to communicate is very important so that there is no wrong understanding of the culture being adopted. Lack of communication can also create clashes between tribes that have an impact on unity and integrity. No less important, we must also pay attention to communication between communities by introducing cultures to each other and to the nation's future generations with the aim of keeping our culture alive.•Closing (Interpretation)Less cultural learning, resulting in our culture gradually disappearing. So, it is better to study culture from an early age, for now there are already subjects in school that discuss cultural issues. But unfortunately, many do not consider it important to study material about culture. Whereas through cultural lessons, we can build national culture and can maintain local culture in this era of globalization. Because in fact Indonesian culture can be preserved in many ways, one of which is by teaching about culture to the children of our nation.Temukan Kalimat Passive dalam bentuk present dan future simple tense dari teks explanation tersebut ​</a>

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

A LETTER TO GOD
By Jayafran
Dear God,
I am sorry not to take the path You made
My forgiveness to obey the spoke You whisper
My apologized to ignore Your prohibition
I am sorry to travel alone without Your guide
Dear God,
Maybe I am to proud to myself
My confidence to choose all my path alone
This greed that wanting more than I need
The selfish arrogant ungraceful man
Now I am lost in the middle of nowhere
Stand between the dark cold scary valley
This darkness makes me loose my sight
The fog does not allowed me to see the light
Dear God,
Slowly my conscious turn to madness
This eyes getting blurry and shaded
The sound of nature fading away I can not hear
My body is numb I can not even stand
Dear God,
I know I just a sinner
Disgrace my self with all my sins
Throw away your blessing grace
Now I just turn into something I am not
Dear God,
Please take my soul away
To take Your undying conviction
I do not deserve to live this life no more
The demon has own my soul forever</a>

He just had to use hisfinger like Paul"Oh no. Paul, a fairy, a beautiful fairy! What makes the pictures?" asked Ellen: Jack Frost paints them, Paul told her "Every night he comes, with an icicle for a paintbrush and wples for his paintbox. First, he breathes on the window like this- Paul blew on the pane and it douded a misty gray-then fast as fast, he draws his pictures" With his finger.

                            9. Ellen didn't know whether she quite believed him or not, but she thought it a lovely story anyway. After breakfast, Ellen put on snowsuit and boots and mittens and hood and went out to play in the yard with Butch, her pet. They romped in the snowbanks and tumbled on the ice. The morning was half gone in a twinkling. Better come in and warm up a bit." Ellen's mother called. And then she laughed. "Goodness! Jack Frost has certainly painted your nose!" Ellen loved the pictures she found on the windows these winter mornings. "Look!" she'd beg Paul. "There's a big castle on a hill-" "And there's the old witch climbing up to it," Paul teased. Ellen tugged off her boots hurriedly. She ran to a mirror, but there were no castles and fairies on her nose-only a bright red color that was already fading! "But it's fading away, Paul!" "Well, I didn't have an icicle paintbrush," Paul explained. "That's the difference." "Well," Ellen decided. "I guess Jack didn't have his icicle paintbrush today. He just had to use his finger, like Paul." "Oh, no, Paul, a fairy, a beautiful fairy! What makes the pictures?" asked Ellen. "Jack Frost paints them," Paul told her. "Every night he comes, with an icicle for a paintbrush and snow pies for his paintbox. First, he breathes on the window like this-"Paul blew on the pane and it clouded a misty gray, "-then, fast as fast, he draws his pictures." With his finger, Paul drew a comical face.

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

The Dying Words of Goethe
“Light more light! The shadows deepen,
And my life is ebbing low,
Throw the windows widely open:
Light! More light before I go
“Softly let the balmy sunshine
Play around my dying bed,
E’er the dimly lighted valley
I with lonely feet must tread
“Light! More light! For Death is weaving
Shadowns ‘round my warning sight,
And I fain would gaze upon him
Through a stream of earthly light.”
Not for greater gifts of genius;
Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
All the dying poet whispers
Is a prayer for light, more light.
Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
Fading slowly from his sight;
All the poet’s aspirations
Centre in that prayer for light
Gracious Saviour, when life’s day-dreams
Melt and vanish from the sight,
May our dim and longing vision
Then be blessed with light, more light. </h2><br />

                            21. "Causes of the Fading of Indonesian Culture"•General Statement (Opening)Culture in Indonesia is increasingly fading due to a lack of public awareness, lack of cultural learning, and lack of cultural communication. This is considered to have dropped dramatically because most of us choose foreign cultures that are more practical and in accordance with the times. That we think that foreign culture is more practical and cool. Even though this is not always true. Even though there are many foreign cultures that are considered cool but are not in accordance with the identity and culture of our nation, Indonesia.• A sequence of  explanationThe result is that our culture is not taken care of and slowly eliminated or claimed by other countries. For this reason, the ability to communicate is very important so that there is no wrong understanding of the culture being adopted. Lack of communication can also create clashes between tribes that have an impact on unity and integrity. No less important, we must also pay attention to communication between communities by introducing cultures to each other and to the nation's future generations with the aim of keeping our culture alive.•Closing (Interpretation)Less cultural learning, resulting in our culture gradually disappearing. So, it is better to study culture from an early age, for now there are already subjects in school that discuss cultural issues. But unfortunately, many do not consider it important to study material about culture. Whereas through cultural lessons, we can build national culture and can maintain local culture in this era of globalization. Because in fact Indonesian culture can be preserved in many ways, one of which is by teaching about culture to the children of our nation.Temukan Kalimat Passive dalam bentuk present dan future simple tense dari teks explanation tersebut ​</h2><br />

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

A LETTER TO GOD
By Jayafran
Dear God,
I am sorry not to take the path You made
My forgiveness to obey the spoke You whisper
My apologized to ignore Your prohibition
I am sorry to travel alone without Your guide
Dear God,
Maybe I am to proud to myself
My confidence to choose all my path alone
This greed that wanting more than I need
The selfish arrogant ungraceful man
Now I am lost in the middle of nowhere
Stand between the dark cold scary valley
This darkness makes me loose my sight
The fog does not allowed me to see the light
Dear God,
Slowly my conscious turn to madness
This eyes getting blurry and shaded
The sound of nature fading away I can not hear
My body is numb I can not even stand
Dear God,
I know I just a sinner
Disgrace my self with all my sins
Throw away your blessing grace
Now I just turn into something I am not
Dear God,
Please take my soul away
To take Your undying conviction
I do not deserve to live this life no more
The demon has own my soul forever</h2><br />

He just had to use hisfinger like Paul"Oh no. Paul, a fairy, a beautiful fairy! What makes the pictures?" asked Ellen: Jack Frost paints them, Paul told her "Every night he comes, with an icicle for a paintbrush and wples for his paintbox.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Ellen was a young girl who loved to play in the snow with her pet dog, Butch. One morning, after breakfast, she put on her snowsuit, boots, mittens, and hood and went outside to play. They romped in the snowbanks and tumbled on the ice. As the morning passed, her mother called her inside to warm up. As she took off her boots, she looked in the mirror and was disappointed to see that there were no castles or fairies on her face. Her mother laughed and said, "Goodness, Jack has certainly painted your nose!"</p><p></p><p>Ellen was confused, but her brother Paul explained that Jack Frost was the one who painted the pictures on the windows every winter morning. He would come at night with an icicle for a paintbrush and snowflakes for his paintbox. He would breathe on the window to create a misty gray and then quickly draw his pictures. Ellen was fascinated and asked Paul to show her how it was done. Paul blew on the window and created a misty gray, and then drew a comical face with his finger. "See?" he said, "Jack Frost paints the pictures with his finger."</p><p></p><p>Ellen was disappointed that she didn't have an icicle paintbrush like Jack Frost, but she was happy to know that she could still create her own pictures with her finger. From that day on, she and Paul would spend their mornings creating their own winter wonderland on the windows.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><br />
