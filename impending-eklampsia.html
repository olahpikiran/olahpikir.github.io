                                            Once Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-E inside the craft Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends, To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her.Cari kata adjective, adverb dan verb di cerita tersebut​</a>

                                            NELSON MANDELA	Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African political activist who spent over 20 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was released in 1990 and, in 1994, was later elected the first leader of a democratic South Africa. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial segregation in South Africa. He is considered the father of democratic South Africa and widely admired for his ability to bring together a nation, previously divided by apartheid. Nelson Mandela is one of the most admired political leaders of the Twentieth and Twenty First Century for his vision to forgive and forge a new ‘rainbow’ nation.	Nelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. He was the son of a local tribal leader of the Tembu tribe. As a youngster, Nelson took part in the activities and initiation ceremonies of his local tribe. However, unlike his father, Nelson Mandela gained a full education, studying at the University College of Fort Hare and also the University of Witwatersrand. Nelson was a good student and qualified with a law degree in 1942.	During his time at University, Nelson Mandela became increasingly aware of the racial inequality and injustice faced by non-white people. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC and actively take part in the struggle against apartheid. In 1956, Nelson Mandela, along with several other members of the ANC were arrested and charged with treason. After a lengthy and protracted court case the defendants were finally acquitted in 1961. However, with the ANC now banned, Nelson Mandela suggested an active armed resistance to the apartheid regime.	In 1963, Mandela was again arrested and put on trial for treason. This time the State succeeded in convicting Mandela and plotting to overthrow the government. Mandela’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and from 1964-1981 he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. In prison the conditions were sparse; however, Mandela was with many other political prisoners and there was a strong bond of friendship which helped to make more bearable the difficult prison conditions. Also, in prison Nelson Mandela was highly disciplined; he would try and study and take part in exercise every day.	Eventually, Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. The day was a huge event for South Africa and the world. His release is the symbolic of the impending end of apartheid. Following his release there followed protracted negotiations, (often interspersed with tribal violence). However, in April 1994, South Africa had its first full and fair elections. The ANC, with 65% of the vote, were elected and Nelson Mandela became the first President of the new South Africa. He died on December 5, 2013 after a long illness with his family at his side.

They are visible air pollution and invepollution Another way of looking at air pollution could be any substance that holds the potential to hinsorb the alumn atmosphere or the well being of the living beingssurviving in it. The sustainment of all things living is omcombination of gases that collectively form the atmosphere, the imbalance caused by the increase or deof the percentage of these gases can be harmful for survival.Below are the causes of air pollution1. Burning of fossil fuels Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal petroleumother factory combustibles is one the major cause of air pollution. Pollution emitting from vehicles incl.trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause immense amount of pollution2.Agricultural activities: Ammonia is a very common by product from agriculture related activities and isof the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Use of insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers in agriculteactivities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water polluti3. Exhaust from factories and industries: Manufacturing industries release large amount of carbon monoxichydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air thereby depleting the quality of aManufacturing industries can be found at every corner of the earth and there is no area that has not beeaffected by it Petroleum refineries also release hydrocarbons and various other chemicals that pollutthe air and also cause land pollution.Here are effects of air pollution1. Respiratory and heart problems: The effects of air pollution are alarming. They are known to create severalrespiratory and heart conditions along with cancer, among other threats to the body. Several millionsare known to have died due to direct or indirect effects of air pollution. Children in areas exposed to airpollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma.2.Global warming: Another direct effect is the immediate alterations that the world is witnessing due to globalwarming. With increased temperatures world wide, increase in sea levels and melting of ice from colderregions and icebergs, displacement and loss of habitat have already signaled an impending disaster ifactions for preservation and normalization aren't undertaken soon.3.Acid rain: Harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere duringthe burning of fossil fuels. When it rains, the water droplets combines with these air pollutants, becomesacidic and then falls on the ground in the form of acid rain. Acid rain can cause great damage to humananimals and crops.Suspended particulate matter popular by its acronym SPM, is another cause of pollution. Referring to theparticles afloat in the air, SPM is usually caused by dust, combustion etc.plants lessability to repeing capacityincturingbased onNumberSynonymsEnglish WordsExhaust6.Task 4Write the synonym of the following words!NumberEnglish Words Synonyms1.

                                            cerita b Inggrispertanyaan nya ada di fotoOnce Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth.When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton. She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly.Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian.Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent.After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique.When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.​</a>

                            7. NELSON MANDELA	Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African political activist who spent over 20 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime. He was released in 1990 and, in 1994, was later elected the first leader of a democratic South Africa. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work in helping to end racial segregation in South Africa. He is considered the father of democratic South Africa and widely admired for his ability to bring together a nation, previously divided by apartheid. Nelson Mandela is one of the most admired political leaders of the Twentieth and Twenty First Century for his vision to forgive and forge a new ‘rainbow’ nation.	Nelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. He was the son of a local tribal leader of the Tembu tribe. As a youngster, Nelson took part in the activities and initiation ceremonies of his local tribe. However, unlike his father, Nelson Mandela gained a full education, studying at the University College of Fort Hare and also the University of Witwatersrand. Nelson was a good student and qualified with a law degree in 1942.	During his time at University, Nelson Mandela became increasingly aware of the racial inequality and injustice faced by non-white people. In 1943, he decided to join the ANC and actively take part in the struggle against apartheid. In 1956, Nelson Mandela, along with several other members of the ANC were arrested and charged with treason. After a lengthy and protracted court case the defendants were finally acquitted in 1961. However, with the ANC now banned, Nelson Mandela suggested an active armed resistance to the apartheid regime.	In 1963, Mandela was again arrested and put on trial for treason. This time the State succeeded in convicting Mandela and plotting to overthrow the government. Mandela’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and from 1964-1981 he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town. In prison the conditions were sparse; however, Mandela was with many other political prisoners and there was a strong bond of friendship which helped to make more bearable the difficult prison conditions. Also, in prison Nelson Mandela was highly disciplined; he would try and study and take part in exercise every day.	Eventually, Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. The day was a huge event for South Africa and the world. His release is the symbolic of the impending end of apartheid. Following his release there followed protracted negotiations, (often interspersed with tribal violence). However, in April 1994, South Africa had its first full and fair elections. The ANC, with 65% of the vote, were elected and Nelson Mandela became the first President of the new South Africa. He died on December 5, 2013 after a long illness with his family at his side. He was 95.1. What is the meaning of “(1918-2013)” in the first sentence?2. What is his role in the world’s society?3. Why is he considered to be one of the most admired political leaders?4. When and where was he born?5. How was he different from his father?6. How did he start to be active in the struggle against apartheid?7. Why was he imprisoned?8.

                            8. Air PollutionAir pollution can further be classified into two sections. They are visible air pollution and invepollution Another way of looking at air pollution could be any substance that holds the potential to hinsorb the alumn atmosphere or the well being of the living beingssurviving in it. The sustainment of all things living is omcombination of gases that collectively form the atmosphere, the imbalance caused by the increase or deof the percentage of these gases can be harmful for survival.Below are the causes of air pollution1. Burning of fossil fuels Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal petroleumother factory combustibles is one the major cause of air pollution. Pollution emitting from vehicles incl.trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause immense amount of pollution2.Agricultural activities: Ammonia is a very common by product from agriculture related activities and isof the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Use of insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers in agriculteactivities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water polluti3. Exhaust from factories and industries: Manufacturing industries release large amount of carbon monoxichydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air thereby depleting the quality of aManufacturing industries can be found at every corner of the earth and there is no area that has not beeaffected by it Petroleum refineries also release hydrocarbons and various other chemicals that pollutthe air and also cause land pollution.Here are effects of air pollution1. Respiratory and heart problems: The effects of air pollution are alarming. They are known to create severalrespiratory and heart conditions along with cancer, among other threats to the body. Several millionsare known to have died due to direct or indirect effects of air pollution. Children in areas exposed to airpollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma.2.Global warming: Another direct effect is the immediate alterations that the world is witnessing due to globalwarming. With increased temperatures world wide, increase in sea levels and melting of ice from colderregions and icebergs, displacement and loss of habitat have already signaled an impending disaster ifactions for preservation and normalization aren't undertaken soon.3.Acid rain: Harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere duringthe burning of fossil fuels. When it rains, the water droplets combines with these air pollutants, becomesacidic and then falls on the ground in the form of acid rain. Acid rain can cause great damage to humananimals and crops.Suspended particulate matter popular by its acronym SPM, is another cause of pollution.

Fight a --
fight a dragon?

00:01:49,543 --&gt; 00:01:51,677
Wrong!
Follow me.

Man, this is stupid as heck.

Yeah, I guess.

53
00:02:02,957 --&gt; 00:02:05,290
I mean, except for
this sweet armor, though.
54
00:02:05,292 --&gt; 00:02:07,292
This armor's hot
like fire.
55
00:02:07,294 --&gt; 00:02:09,495
Nah.
The armor's stupid, too.
56
00:02:09,497 --&gt; 00:02:12,164
Dang king of ooo,
going around
like d.J. Snappy.

This is it, fellas --
58

the only spot in the kingdom
left unscoured
59
00:02:16,137 --&gt; 00:02:17,636
during my treasure census.
60
00:02:17,638 --&gt; 00:02:20,139
I'm afraid it'll explode
or something if I open it.
61
00:02:20,141 --&gt; 00:02:21,840
But I really think
there could --
62
nay, there might
be precious treasures in there,
63
so I want you two
to do it.
64
00:02:27,148 --&gt; 00:02:30,149
Man, this seems like
a really bad idea.
65
00:02:30,151 --&gt; 00:02:32,684
Yeah, well, it's an order
from your princess.
66
00:02:32,686 --&gt; 00:02:33,752
Git, git, git!
67
00:02:33,754 --&gt; 00:02:34,987
