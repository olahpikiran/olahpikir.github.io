Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates. She, however, declined any proposal. She became very sad and was crying everyday. The old parents couldn't understand why and couldn't get the daughter to answer.
On a full moon night, she decided to tell why she was crying . she told them that she hand to leave them and the house and return tp thr moon . the old perents were shocked and sad as well

                                            There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: “free, free, free!” The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.  She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for her during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow- creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  “Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. “Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven’s sake open the door.”  “Go away. I am not making myself ill.” No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.  But Richards was too late.  When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates. She, however, declined any proposal. She became very sad and was crying everyday. The old parents couldn't understand why and couldn't get the daughter to answer.
On a full moon night, she decided to tell why she was crying and to say she had to leave home and go back to the moon. She was frustrated for a long time because the time for her departure had come. The moon beams arrived to transport her back to the moon. She said good-bye to her old parents and gave them an elixir of life as a good-bye gift. The old parents lived a long life after that.</a>

                                            1. What is the topic and topic sentence of each text below?a. Scientists have learned to supplement the sense of sight in numerous ways. In frontof the tiny pupil of the eye they put, on mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inchesin diameter, and with it see 2000 times farther into the depths of space. Or they lookthrough a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope into a drop of water or blood,and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there, many of whichare among man’s most dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happeningson earth, they use some of the previously wasted electromagnetic waves to carrytelevision images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a screenwith electrons in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away ascolored motion pictures, by arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing molecules toforce light waves into the patterns of original reality. Or if we want to see into thecenter of a steel casting or the chest of an injured child, they send the information ona beam of penetrating short-wave x rays, and then convert it back into images we cansee on a screen or photograph. Thus almost every type of electromagnetic radiationyet discovered has been used to extend our sense of sight in some way.b. Water is the most precious elixir the mankind possesses. For centuries, it has beeneasily accessible and thus its importance has been underestimated. Water helps inmost of the processes going on in human body.It is clearly quintessential for the humans. But it is also of prime importance tothe other organisms present in our biosphere, namely trees and vegetation, birds,animals and insects. Today, enormous land masses face water scarcity. Clean, potablewater is now a luxury instead of necessity in many regions. Therefore, as the mostintelligent species living on earth, every individual should strive to realize theimportance of this elixir and partake in efforts to conserve it.c. Independence Day is a National Festival of India celebrated on 15th of August everyyear. India became a free country on this day and it’s only then we could secure ourdemocratic rights as citizens of India. Our Independence gives us the reason to enjoyour fundamental rights laid down by the constitution. We are now a self-governeddemocratic country and have the voting rights. The feeling of self-reliance andfreedom fills the heart of the citizens with supreme happiness and joy. It is all due tothe tireless efforts and numerous sacrifices of several great people who sacrificedtheir lives without any fear.d. We have many different activities to do. Our activities make up our work. Our state ofmind and attitude regarding our work can make all the difference. If we workgrudgingly and with complaints we neither enjoy the work we do nor do we get thedesired results easily or soon.It is when we engage in worship that our mind is in a state of reverence, love,purity, simplicity and honesty. When we bring these qualities to the work we do, wetreat work as worship. When we work with dedication and sincerity we can easilymeet our targets.​</a>

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates.

                            10. There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: “free, free, free!” The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.  She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for her during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow- creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  “Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. “Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven’s sake open the door.”  “Go away. I am not making myself ill.” No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.  But Richards was too late.  When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.

                            19. 1. What is the topic and topic sentence of each text below?a. Scientists have learned to supplement the sense of sight in numerous ways. In frontof the tiny pupil of the eye they put, on mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inchesin diameter, and with it see 2000 times farther into the depths of space. Or they lookthrough a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope into a drop of water or blood,and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there, many of whichare among man’s most dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happeningson earth, they use some of the previously wasted electromagnetic waves to carrytelevision images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a screenwith electrons in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away ascolored motion pictures, by arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing molecules toforce light waves into the patterns of original reality. Or if we want to see into thecenter of a steel casting or the chest of an injured child, they send the information ona beam of penetrating short-wave x rays, and then convert it back into images we cansee on a screen or photograph. Thus almost every type of electromagnetic radiationyet discovered has been used to extend our sense of sight in some way.b. Water is the most precious elixir the mankind possesses. For centuries, it has beeneasily accessible and thus its importance has been underestimated. Water helps inmost of the processes going on in human body.It is clearly quintessential for the humans. But it is also of prime importance tothe other organisms present in our biosphere, namely trees and vegetation, birds,animals and insects. Today, enormous land masses face water scarcity. Clean, potablewater is now a luxury instead of necessity in many regions. Therefore, as the mostintelligent species living on earth, every individual should strive to realize theimportance of this elixir and partake in efforts to conserve it.c. Independence Day is a National Festival of India celebrated on 15th of August everyyear. India became a free country on this day and it’s only then we could secure ourdemocratic rights as citizens of India. Our Independence gives us the reason to enjoyour fundamental rights laid down by the constitution. We are now a self-governeddemocratic country and have the voting rights. The feeling of self-reliance andfreedom fills the heart of the citizens with supreme happiness and joy. It is all due tothe tireless efforts and numerous sacrifices of several great people who sacrificedtheir lives without any fear.d. We have many different activities to do. Our activities make up our work. Our state ofmind and attitude regarding our work can make all the difference. If we workgrudgingly and with complaints we neither enjoy the work we do nor do we get thedesired results easily or soon.It is when we engage in worship that our mind is in a state of reverence, love,purity, simplicity and honesty. When we bring these qualities to the work we do, wetreat work as worship. When we work with dedication and sincerity we can easilymeet our targets.​</h2><br />
